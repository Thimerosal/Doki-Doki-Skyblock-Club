This is the release of my mod Doki Doki Skyblock Club for Doki Doki Literature Club!

If you have never installed a DDLC mod before don't worry its actually pretty simple! Here is a brief explanation:
1. Download vanilla DDLC from Steam or the stand alone download at https://ddlc.moe. Make sure that you get the free version of DDLC and not DDLC plus. Also download the latest version of DDSBC from the link at the top of the description.
2. If you are using the stand alone download extract it into a folder of your choice, if you're on steam right click the game and select browse local files. In either case this folder should have DDLC.exe along with several other files.
3. Locate your download of DDSBC and open it (you don't need to unzip it). There will be another folder located inside of it, enter that folder and you should see another folder titled 'game'. Simply copy this 'game' folder into the directory where your vanilla DDLC files are located (discussed in step 2).
4. Windows will tell you that there is another file titled 'scripts' and ask if you want to replace it. Be sure to confirm this prompt so that windows replaces the vanilla scripts file with the new one from DDSBC.
5. Assuming you did everything correct simply launch DDLC.exe (or press play on steam) and the mod should launch. If you see a screen pop up telling you that DDSBC is a mod and not affiliated with Team Salvato then you likely did everything correct and can play the mod as normal.
